***Insecure direct object references or IDOR for short is an access control vulnerability where a user can gain access to information that should be protected often simply by just altering a record ID or reference***

* Example:
	https://example.com/user_id=5 -> https://example.com/user_id=1 We can try to change the 'user_id' by other and gain access to confidential information.
