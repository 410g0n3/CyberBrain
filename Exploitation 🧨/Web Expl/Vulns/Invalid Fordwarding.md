***Forwarding is the action of a webserver telling your browser when you view a webpage to redirect to another URL instead. You'll see it most often in password protected areas of a website where you get redirected to a login page so you can authenticate. Webservers perform this action by responding with a Location HTTP header and a HTTP status code of either 302 or 301***
