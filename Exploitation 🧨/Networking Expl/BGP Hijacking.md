# BGP - Border Gateway Protocol
BGP is used for reachability information and routing data packets from one large network to another. Its goal is to _provide directions to the traffic as efficiently as possible by favoring the shortest paths and specific IP ranges_
Each Autonomous System advertises their list of IP addresses and the neighboring Autonomous Systems (routers) they can connect to — the neighboring routers known as Peers.
The list of the advertised IPs and Peers information is stored in the routing tables of the Autonomous Systems. These tables are regularly updated to include new networks, IP spaces, and the shortest paths.

# BGP Hijacking
BGP hijacking is sending traffic to a different destination than the real intended one to intercept the packets . For the “hijack’’ to work, there are three main factors:
1) The malicious announcement of BGP routes has to come from a legitimate Autonomous System, either a compromised one or an operator. Not anyone can announce BGP routes to the global network peers.
2) The IP ranges chosen for the advertisement have to be more specific than the legitimate ones.
3) The routes have to claim that they offer the shorter path since BGP relies on that for fast and efficient packet delivery.
